/**
 * The extends keyword can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects.
 *
 * Any constructor that can be called with new and has the prototype property can
 * be the candidate for the parent class. The two conditions must both hold â€” for
 * example, bound functions and Proxy can be constructed, but they don't have
 * a prototype property, so they cannot be subclassed.
 *
 * The prototype property of the ParentClass must be an Object or null.
 *
 * While the base class may return anything from its constructor, the derived class
 * must return an object or undefined, or a TypeError will be thrown.
 *
 * The reserved 'super' keyword is for making super-constructor calls and allows
 * access to parent methods.
 *
 * Note: In derived classes, super() must be called before you can use 'this'.
 * Leaving this out will cause a reference error.
 *
 * Methods of a sub class will override the parent's, meaning, that sub class that
 * are missing a method, will fall back to the super class method. This is called Polymorphism.
