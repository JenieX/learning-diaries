/**
 * Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit
 * features from one another.
 *
 * Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called
 * its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype
 * will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain.
 * The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
 *
 * By specifying __proto__ (also known as our objectâ€™s prototype),
 * we instruct JavaScript to continue looking for missing properties
 * on that object instead.
